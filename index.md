## About Me

I am a PhD student in the [Center of Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing)
hosted by [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc)
supervised by [Alex Lascarides](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alex/) and [Subramanian Ramamoorthy](http://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/)

I am working on [Interactive Task Learning](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/interactive-task-learning) and how the complexities of natural interaction with human teachers can help to learn new tasks more effectively. In particular, I am studying how complex natural language can help to obtain knowledge about new concepts introduced as part of the embodied conversation to guide an agent's understanding of the domain.

## Research Interests

- **Grounding**: incrementally learning grounding models as part of human-robot interaction in embodied conversation.
- **Planning**: solving sequential decision problems in the embodied environment
- **Reasoning**: exploring logical, probabilistic, and causal reasoning about  the world to be able to answer complex questions about it.

## News

- **[Feb. 2022]** Our paper about incremental symbol grounding with complex referential expressions is accepted to NAACL 2022.
