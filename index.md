## About Me

I am a PhD student in the [Center of Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing)
hosted by [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc)
supervised by [Alex Lascarides](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alex/) and [Subramanian Ramamoorthy](http://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/)

I am working on [Interactive Task Learning](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/interactive-task-learning) and how the complexities of natural interaction with human teachers can aid in learning novel tasks 

## Research Interests

- **Reasoning**: exploring logical, probabilistic, and causal reasoning about the world to be able to answer complex queries.
- **Grounding**: incrementally learning grounding models as part of human-robot interaction in embodied conversation.
- **Planning**: solving sequential decision problems.

## News

- **[Feb. 2022]** Our paper about incremental symbol grounding with complex referential expressions is accepted to NAACL 2022.

## Publications

## Services

- Reviewing: [EMNLP2022](https://2022.emnlp.org/), [EMNLP2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/)
- Teaching: during my time at the University of Edinburgh I have provided teaching support (TA, tutor, marker, demonstrator) for a variety of courses in the undergraduate and postgraduate studies covering topics in foundational artificial intelligence, probabilistic machine learning, and natural language processing.
